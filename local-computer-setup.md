# Local Setup

#### _To enable local building and publishing_

There is an advantage to being able to control your own building and publishing.  Sometimes relying on cloud applications can be a problem as they are in a constant state of development.

In this article you learn how to set up an environment which will allow you to build and publish your own Gitbook website.

You will need to download and install the following programs:

* Visual Studio Code \(optional editor, but recommended\)
* git
* node

After git is installed, you will create a repository.  With the repository created, you will clone it to your local computer.  This will create a local directory and then you can copy the following files into the directory created by cloning your repository.

* gulpfile.js
* package.json
* .gitignore
* book.json

You'll need to modify the following data in package.json to customize it for your work.

* name
* description
* repository
* author
* bugs
* homepage

Once you have node installed you will need to use the Node Package Manager, npm to install the following packages globally:

* gitbook-cli
* gulp
